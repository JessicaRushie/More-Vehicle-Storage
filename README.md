*****************************************************************************************************************************
This is a MOD for 7 Days To Die Alpha 18.

This adds bigger storage slots to all Vehicles, even modded ones that use the original template.

It's safe to use with a Faster Vehicle MOD.

<HOW TO>
Simply place the unzipped file into your 7 Days To Die\Mods Folder.
EG, "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods"

You are free to use this MOD any way you like,
however i would like credit if it's used in a MOD Pack and such as it took me quite a long time to make.
